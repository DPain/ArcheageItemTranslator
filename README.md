# ArcheageItemTranslator
### Quick summary: ###
Makes use of archeagedatabase.net &amp; Selenium. This automates an item search within the archeagedatabase.net website in order to either translate an English -> Korean or a Korean -> English translation.
I couldn't really find a way to sent a GET/POST request to easily get the translation so I used this inefficient and slow method. There are several glitches known already. Whenever I get time, I'll probably fix it.
